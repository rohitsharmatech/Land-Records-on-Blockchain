# Land Records on Blockchain
Unlike developed countries, the property ownership details in developing countries isn't only inefficient, but is also error-prone and can be manipulated. Also several malpractices still exist in the system just due to lack of a transparent and immutable system. Therefore, we propose a Blockchain based solution to curb the flaws of the existing system.

# Technical Details 

Ganache

Truffle

Metamask

Solidity js

Knowledge of basic Javascript etc.

# Functions are:


i. createProperty() - It creates a property on the blockchain.


ii. getPropertyDetails() - It tells the property details of a particular property.


ii. transferProperty() - It is used to transfer property from one owner to the new one.

# Modifiers used:


isAdmin - Admin is the one who approves the sale of property, so this tells if the user is an admin or not.

sellerOwnsproperty - checks whether the person selling the property is the actual owner.

We have also made the front end for the same and its functional as well.
